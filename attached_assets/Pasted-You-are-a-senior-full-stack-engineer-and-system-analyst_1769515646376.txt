You are a senior full-stack engineer and system analyst.

Build a web-based task tracking dashboard with role-based access control (RBAC),
using Google Sheets as the primary data source.

DATA SOURCE:
Google Sheets (public access):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EocmoQcjYbXBaleojrV7LLlgjZTjOvkyZxEb_bHJETM/edit?usp=sharing

Assume the sheet contains structured task management data
(e.g. Task ID, Task Name, Description, Assignee, Role, Status, Priority, Start Date, Due Date, Progress, Notes).

SYSTEM GOAL:
Create a professional internal dashboard for task monitoring and reporting,
suitable for enterprise project management and BA demonstration.

USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS:

1. ADMIN
- Full access to all data
- View, create, edit, delete tasks
- Assign tasks to any user
- Modify task status, priority, deadlines
- View overall analytics (progress, overdue tasks, workload)
- Manage users and roles (logical UI only, no authentication backend required)

2. MANAGER
- View all tasks under their team or department
- Edit task status, progress, and comments
- Cannot delete tasks or manage users
- View summarized reports and KPIs
- Filter by assignee, status, priority, timeline

3. EMPLOYEE
- View only tasks assigned to them
- Update task status and progress
- Add comments or notes
- Read-only access to other tasks (optional or hidden)

ROLE HANDLING:
- Simulate role selection via dropdown or query parameter
- No real authentication required
- UI behavior must change based on selected role

FEATURE REQUIREMENTS:

DASHBOARD OVERVIEW
- Total tasks
- Completed vs In-progress vs Overdue
- Progress visualization (progress bar or simple chart)
- Task status breakdown

TASK LIST VIEW
- Table view with sorting & filtering
- Columns dynamically loaded from Google Sheets
- Color-coded status & priority
- Click task to view detail panel/modal

TASK DETAIL VIEW
- Task information
- Assigned user
- Status & progress update (role-dependent)
- Notes/comments section

DATA HANDLING
- Fetch data directly from Google Sheets using public CSV or JSON endpoint
- Read-only write-back simulation (no actual write required)
- Clean data parsing and error handling

TECH STACK:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla preferred)
- Optional lightweight library (e.g. Chart.js) for charts
- Responsive layout (desktop-first)
- Modular, readable code
- Clear separation between data, logic, and UI

DESIGN STYLE:
- Professional, enterprise dashboard
- Neutral colors (white, gray, dark blue accents)
- Clear typography
- Focus on clarity and usability over decoration

UX PRINCIPLES:
- Easy to scan
- Role-based UI visibility
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Logical grouping of information

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Complete runnable project in Replit
- Single-page application structure
- Well-commented code explaining:
  * Role-based logic
  * Data parsing
  * UI rendering decisions
- No fake data unless required for fallback

IMPORTANT:
This project should demonstrate:
- Business Analyst thinking (process, roles, permissions)
- System design logic
- UI/UX clarity
- Enterprise-level professionalism

Do NOT create a toy app.
Do NOT hardcode task data unless Google Sheets is unreachable.
